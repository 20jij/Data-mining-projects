Emory CS470 Data Mining Projects

## hw1
Performed data cleaning, manipulation, and re-encoding to derive meaningful insights on Emory students grade distribution in CS courses.

## hw2
Implemented Apriori algorithm in Python. Optimized algorithm to decrease its runtime by 80% when running on large dataset (100,000 data entries).

## hw3
Implemented K-means clustering algorithm and measure its performance on multiple datasets using the Elbow method.

## hw4
Implemented PageRank algorithm that rank vertices(websites) in a directed graph. Designed the algorithm to deal with spider traps and deadends.

## hw5
Implemented MinHash algorithm in Java to identify highly similar articles, which is a efficient and optimized way to estimate Jaccard Similarity between ariticles.
